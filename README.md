# Application of Machine Learning to Epileptic Seizure Detection.
This project is to follow Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining steps to detect and classify the onset of Epileptic seizures in patient-specific EEG data. Performed signal processing of the raw EEG data and designed three classification models to recognize/predict seizure during the first 24 hours of EEG recordings.
Implementation is done in Jupiter Notebook to perform preliminary analysis & visualize data using Matplotlib. 
Used sensitivity/ specificity analysis and 5-fold cross-validation, along with MCC for Validation.
